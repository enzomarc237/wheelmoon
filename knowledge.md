# WheelMoon Project Knowledge

## Project Overview
WheelMoon is a spec-driven development project focused on creating applications through structured specifications, plans, and tasks.

## Project Structure
- `specs/` - Contains feature specifications organized by numbered directories
- `spec-driven-docs/` - Documentation for the spec-driven development methodology
- `scripts/` - Automation scripts for project management
- `templates/` - Template files for creating new specifications and plans
- `memory/` - Project constitution and guidelines
- `.github/prompts/` - GitHub-related prompt templates

## Development Workflow
1. Specifications are created in numbered directories under `specs/`
2. Each spec includes: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md
3. Scripts help automate the creation and management of features
4. The constitution in `memory/` defines core principles

## Key Scripts
- `setup-plan.sh` - Sets up planning for features
- `create-new-feature.sh` - Creates new feature directories
- `check-task-prerequisites.sh` - Validates task prerequisites

## Current Work
Currently working on specification "001-cr√©er-une-application" for creating an application.
